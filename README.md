# RabbitMQ Binding Support for Azure Functions

The Azure Functions RabbitMQ Binding extensions allows you to send and receive messages using the RabbitMQ API but by writing Functions code. The RabbitMQ output binding sends messages to a specific queue. The RabbitMQ trigger fires when it receives a message from a specific queue.

[RabbitMQ Documentation for the .NET Client](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet-api-guide.html)

# Samples

See the repository [wiki](https://github.com/katiecai/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki) for more detailed samples of bindings to different types.

## Output Binding

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using RabbitMQ.Client;
using RabbitMQ.Client.Events;

public static void TimerTrigger_StringOutput(
    [TimerTrigger("00:01")] TimerInfo timer,
    [RabbitMQ(
        Hostname = "localhost",
        QueueName = "queue")] out string outputMessage)
{
    outputMessage = "hello"
}
```

The above example waits on a timer trigger to fire (every second) before sending a message to the queue named "queue" connected to the localhost port. The message we want to send is then bound to the variable outputMessage.

## Trigger Binding

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.RabbitMQ;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using RabbitMQ.Client;
using RabbitMQ.Client.Events;

public static void RabbitMQTrigger_String(
    [RabbitMQTrigger("localhost", "queue")] string message,
    ILogger logger
    )
{
    logger.LogInformation($"RabbitMQ queue trigger function processed message: {message}");
}
```

This function is triggered on a message from the queue "queue" connected to the localhost port. The received message is bound to the variable message and is processed by the function.
