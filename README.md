# RabbitMQ Binding Support for Azure Functions

The Azure Functions RabbitMQ Binding extensions allows you to send and receive messages using the RabbitMQ API but by writing Functions code. The RabbitMQ output binding sends messages to a specific queue. The RabbitMQ trigger fires when it receives a message from a specific queue.

[RabbitMQ Documentation for the .NET Client](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet-api-guide.html)

To get started with developing with this extension, make sure you first [set up a RabbitMQ endpoint](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki/Setting-up-a-RabbitMQ-Endpoint). Then you can go ahead and begin developing your functions in [C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki/Samples-in-C%23), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki/Samples-in-JavaScript), or [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki/Samples-in-Python). If you would like a way to handle messages that error, check out our [guide to configuring a dead letter exchange](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki/Configuring-a-Dead-Letter-Exchange-and-Queue).

# Samples

See the repository [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki) for more detailed samples of bindings to different types.

```C#
public static void RabbitMQTrigger_RabbitMQOutput(
    [RabbitMQTrigger("RabbitMQConnection", "queue")] string inputMessage,
    [RabbitMQ(
        ConnectionStringSetting = "RabbitMQConnection",
        QueueName = "hello")] out string outputMessage,
    ILogger logger)
{
    outputMessage = inputMessage;
    logger.LogInformation($"RabittMQ output binding function sent message: {outputMessage}");
}
```

The above sample waits on a trigger from the queue named "queue" connected to the connection string value of key "RabbitMQConnection." The output binding takes the messages from the trigger queue and outputs them to queue "hello" connected to the connection configured by the key "RabibtMQConnection". When running locally, add the connection string setting to local.settings.json file. When running in Azure, add this setting as [Application Setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) for your app.
